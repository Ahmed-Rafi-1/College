            Biryani is my favourite dish because of its spicy flavour, and delicious blend of rice, meat, and spices.
            Each bite is a perfect mix of tender meat and long-grain basmati rice cooked with saffron and herbs.
            Whether it's chicken, mutton, or veg biryani, the taste always feels satisfying.
            It's a dish that brings both comfort and celebration to any meal.
